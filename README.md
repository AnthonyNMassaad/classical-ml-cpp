# Machine Learning in C++

## Overview
This repository contains **classical machine learning models implemented from scratch in C++**.  
The focus is on understanding algorithms at a low level, writing clean code, and gaining practical experience with model training and inference without relying on external ML libraries.

---

## Purpose
The intent of this project is to:
- Practice machine learning fundamentals
- Implement core algorithms manually in C++
- Understand how models behave internally
- Build reusable, well-structured ML code
- Strengthen system-level and algorithmic thinking

---

## Implemented Models
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  Distance-based classifier using Euclidean distance.

- **Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
  Implemented using hinge loss, L2 regularization, and gradient descent, with a one-vs-rest strategy for multi-class classification.

---

## Pipeline
Each experiment follows a standard supervised learning pipeline:
1. Dataset loading
2. Preprocessing (shuffling, train/test split)
3. Model training
4. Prediction
5. Evaluation
